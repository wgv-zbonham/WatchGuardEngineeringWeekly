The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement

![The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519C2Gz-v2L._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This is not even a software related book, at least not directly.  You can even ignore the chapters where the protagonists marriage is falling apart due to the pressures of an IT lifestyle.   But, do slow down and read the chapters describing ideas, and examples, of the Theory of Constraints and Value Stream Mapping.  Its possible that this book resonated with me due to twelve years in the manufacturing sector, however, there are many valid (and not so valid) analogies between manufacturing a finished good, "manufacturing" software, and the strategies used to streamline processes and eliminate waste.

The Phoenix Project is an attempt to re-imagine The Goal specifically in the light of delivering a failing software project.  In my opinion, it does capture the mechanics of what The Goal is trying to communicate, but definitely not the spirit.  YMMV.
